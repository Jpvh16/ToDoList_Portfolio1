# Branching strategy: Git flow model. 
The following branching strategy includes five branches:
1. Main Branch – The main production branch, containing tested and stable code.
2. Dev Branch – A branch for ongoing development of the project. New fixes and features are merged into this branch before being pulled into main and release. This is the primary branch for development.
3. Feature Branch – Used for developing new features for the product. Typically named feature/feature-name, then merged into the dev branch before deleting the feature branch.
4. Release Branch – Used to prepare the next version for production, including final testing and minor bug fixes.
5. Hotfix Branch – Used to patch critical bugs in production.
